'Titanic' will never not leave me utterly floored. It's been several months since I last watched this, so I'm trying to remain calmâ€¦but it just means so damn much when you cherish the commitment and physical craft a production like this takes and how miraculous it is, not only that Cameron's film turned out this spectacularly, but that we will likely never see an undertaking of this caliber ever again. That deafening mechanical roar when the all the lights go out, like a groaning beast from the deep....chills every time."]))

The film is ridiculous just as it should be, but there is a creepiness about Bean in some moments that I couldn't get past. Rowan Atkinson is still funny though and still keeps the character the same, its just that at some parts I wondered how weird they were trying to make him. I also still feel that they cannot make a 90 minute movie about Mr. Bean and keep it interesting all the way through, because honestly I was bored at many times. Its pretty much the same as the first film, other than doing the smart thing and getting rid of a story and just doing a series of Bean's trouble makings."]))
